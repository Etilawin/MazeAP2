:mod:`maze` module

:author: `Kim Vall√©e <kim.vallee.etu@univ-lille.fr>`_

:date:  2018, november

This module implements the class to create a maze. The maze may be built by hand, by file or by algorithm.
Every choice is referenced in the MAZE class that allows specific flags.
It is also able to find the path one point to another if it exists.
The maze can be then saved into a file or printed on screen using the module `graphicalmaze`.

This module uses from :mod:`Cell`:

* :method:`Cell.make_visited`
* :method:`Cell.get_neighbors`
* :method:`Cell.remove_wall_between_cell`
* :method:`Cell.get_accessible_neighbors`
